**_2048_** __is a single-player _sliding block puzzle game_ The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048, which is played on a gray 4×4 grid, with numbered tiles that slide smoothly..__

__when a player moves them using the four arrow keys.Every turn, a new tile will randomly appear in an empty spot on the board with a value of either 2 or 4. Tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they are stopped by either another tile or the edge of the grid.__

__If two tiles of the same number collide while moving, they will merge into a tile with the total value of the two tiles that collided. The resulting tile cannot merge with another tile again in the same move. Higher-scoring tiles emit a soft glow.__
